An article from August 2015 goes into some detail on the environment for LGBT people in Yemen. Murders of gay men continue to be reported. \nIn its 2nd cycle UPR in January 2014, there were no recommendations made by States to Yemen in regards to SOGI. In fact, it appears that there was only one passing mention of SOGI in the 18 civil society and other submissions. Unlike at its 1st cycle UPR in May 2009 where there was one, there were no oral statements made at the close of Yemen’s 2nd cycle UPR. Yemen’s next UPR will be in October 2018. \n\n",
